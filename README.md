# TG_OpenBCI_newCyton
This is a minimalist Python module for controlling the biomedical signal sampling board OpenBCI Cyton. This module aims to recover the functionality of the Python code available in the OpenBCI site, specifically for the control of the OpenBCI Cyton board in the Python language.
The "newCyton.py" file contains the functions to control the OpenBCI Cyton board, such as customizing the sampling channels and changing the sample rate.
The "useCyton.py" file is used as an interface with the OpenBCI Cyton board, using the functions available in newCyton.py.
Within the "docs" folder, there is documentation available for the files, made with the Sphinx extension for Python.
